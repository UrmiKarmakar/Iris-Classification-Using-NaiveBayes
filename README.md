# Iris-Classification-Using-NaiveBayes
This repository contains an end-to-end implementation of a Naive Bayes classifier applied to the Iris dataset. It demonstrates essential steps such as data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation of classification performance. The project also includes visualizations to explore the dataset and interpret the model's results.
